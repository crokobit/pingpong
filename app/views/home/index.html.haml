    So here we go. Submit gist + description and maybe we can get DHH to present his version.

.row
  = link_to new_pong_path, class: 'btn btn-primary btn-submit' do
    Submit your ping-pong for DHH
    = image_tag 'white-pong.png'

.row
  %h1 Recent Ping Pongs
  %hr
  %ul.pong_list
    = render pongs
